# L4D2_Machine

Provides smart, deployable turrets and gatling guns with 8 different types of ammo:

- standard
- tesla
- nauseating
- fire
- laser
- freeze ray
- incentiary
- explosive


Gatling guns are weaker, have less ammo and cannot be moved.

Turrets can be carried around and can take more hit.
Both types explode after getting too much damage.

Supports classic mode, which simply spawns single portable turret.

Improved enemy detection and logic for prioritising attacks

Highly configurable
